# dat-polyfill
Add support for the DatArchive API to the web

First, run `npm start`.

To run the demo, run 'build-demo', cd to the demo dir, and launch a web server (http-server for example)

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/server/ and you'll see a text entry box with an iframe that comes from demo/client.

## Development

Run `npm run watch-demo` to watch for changes.
